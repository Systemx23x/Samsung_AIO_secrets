and I have create a Special-Pack for "SM-S901B 256GB" that have 3 Super-Partitions and 3 Userdata-Partitions

with "BeyondROM 5.4,Google Android 15 Beta & LineageOS 21",the BeyondROM comes with Compactible Flashable

Files, but Google Android 15 Beta and LineageOS 21 comes as GSIs and i must first Build a Super.img File wich was make

with "repacksuper" and so I have Beginning this Expierience.

What the Poster has not Known, each Super/System Partition needs his Own Userdata Partition to run Correctly.

All in One have I collect the Binarys and write a view easy little Scripts to make the Switching between the Systems Easyer.

And It works like a Charm.
