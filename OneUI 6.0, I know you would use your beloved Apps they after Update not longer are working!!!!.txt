Hi,

So for all they have Recived and Update their Device to OneUI 6.0, have now the same Problem, the SDK Version has canged so that many of your beloved Apps are no longer working on Android 14!!!!



It's a sad thing to get rid of tried and tested apps that you've used for years and then find something new:sneaky:

But we can smile because there is surely ONE way to bring it back to us,
for that we must use adb and one command with a FLAG,

Sure you must Download the Apps from Websites but thats ok, then google is not shown Incompactible Apps, so i can say Apkpure is OK

Type in Terminal

adb install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block xxxxxx.apk

Finish

MFG
